## Overview

Variables

In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the = operator. For example:

```
x = 10
y = "hello"
```
You can also assign multiple variables at the same time:

```
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
```

## What to know 

Here are some things to know about variables in Python:

1. Variables are used to store values in a program.
1. You can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the = operator.
1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore `(_)` and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
1. Variable names are case-sensitive.
1. Python has several built-in data types, including numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
1. You can use the type() function to check the data type of a variable.
1. You can use the isinstance() function to check if a variable is an instance of a particular data type.
1. You can convert between data types using functions such as int(), float(), and str().

**Here is an example of using variables in Python**:

```
# Assign a value to a variable
x = 10

# Check the data type of a variable
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

# Check if a variable is an instance of a particular data type
print(isinstance(x, int))  # True

# Convert a variable to a different data type
y = str(x)
print(type(y))  # <class 'str'>
```
