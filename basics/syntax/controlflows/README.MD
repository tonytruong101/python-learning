## Overview

You can use control flow statements in Python to control the flow of execution of your code. Some common control flow statements include if statements, for loops, and while loops.

```
# If statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
  print("x is greater than 5")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
  print(i)

# While loop
x = 5
while x > 0:
  print(x)
  x -= 1
```

You can also use else clauses to specify what should happen if the condition in the if statement is not met:

```
x = 3
if x > 5:
  print("x is greater than 5")
else:
  print("x is not greater than 5")
```

You can use as many elif clauses as you want to check for multiple conditions:

```
x = 3
if x > 5:
  print("x is greater than 5")
elif x > 0:
  print("x is greater than 0")
else:
  print("x is not greater than 0")
```

It's also possible to use conditions in a single line using an inline if statement:

```
x = 10
result = "x is greater than 5" if x > 5 else "x is not greater than 5"
print(result)  # "x is greater than 5"
```
