## Overview

You can define your own functions in Python using the def keyword. Functions can take arguments and return values.

```
def add(x, y):
  return x + y

result = add(10, 5)  # 15
```

## What to know

Here are some things to know about functions in Python:

1. Functions are blocks of code that can be called by name and execute a specific task.
1. You can define your own functions in Python using the def keyword.
1. Functions can take arguments, which are values that are passed to the function when it is called.
1. Functions can return values using the return keyword.
1. You can specify default values for arguments in the function definition, which will be used if the argument is not provided when the function is called.
1. You can use the `args` and `kwargs` syntax to define a function that can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
1. You can use the docstring at the beginning of a function definition to provide documentation for the function.

Here is an example of defining and calling a function in Python:

```
def greet(name):
  """Print a greeting message."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Call the function
greet("John")  # Hello, John!
```
