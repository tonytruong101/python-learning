## Overview

Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

```
# Numbers
x = 10  # integer
y = 10.5  # float

# Strings
s = "hello"

# Lists
l = [1, 2, 3]

# Tuples
t = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionaries
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
```

## What to know

Here are some things to know about data types in Python:

1. Data types are used to classify different kinds of data and determine how they can be used in a program.
1. Python has several built-in data types, including:
```
Numbers (integers and floats)
Strings
Lists
Tuples
Dictionaries
Sets
```
1. You can use the type() function to check the data type of a variable.
1. You can use the isinstance() function to check if a variable is an instance of a particular data type.
1. You can convert between data types using functions such as int(), float(), and str().

Here is an example of using data types in Python:

```
# Numbers (integers and floats)
x = 10  # integer
y = 10.5  # float

# Strings
s = "hello"

# Lists
l = [1, 2, 3]

# Tuples
t = (1, 2, 3)

# Dictionaries
d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Sets
s = {1, 2, 3}

# Check the data type of a variable
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

# Check if a variable is an instance of a particular data type
print(isinstance(x, int))  # True

# Convert a variable to a different data type
y = str(x)
print(type(y))  # <class 'str'>

```
